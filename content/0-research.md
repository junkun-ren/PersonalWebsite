*Uptake*: there is a linear trade-off between phytoplankton's investment in N update and P uptake, indicating by p_N + p_P = 1. An increase in the relative investment in N uptake (p_N) would mean a decrease in the relative investment in P uptake meanwhile. In this model, it is also assumed that this uptake trade-off trait p_N can be an evolving trait which depends on parameter V. V is the genetic variance of this trait, V = 0 means this trait can't evolve at all. <br/>
*Growth of phytoplankton*: it is limited by the limiting element. <br/>
*Grazing*: besides the maximum grazing rate and predation half saturation constant, the grazing rate of zooplankton also depends on the cell element quota difference between zooplankton and phytoplankton (i.e., nutritional quality). The probability that zooplankton will consume encountered phytoplankton follows Gaussian distribution, whose width depends on the selectivity of zooplankton. Higher selectivity gives a more narrow distribution, reducing the probability of grazing on lower quality phytoplankton. the grazing probability is maximized when consumer and 

After I have this model, I started to think about if two zooplankton could coexist in this system. If two zooplankton have different demands of nutrition - one is N-demanding, the other is P-demanding, can they coexist on one species of phytoplankton? Could be, it would be because of a balance between food quantity and quality

If the two zooplankton can actually exist, will that enhance the coexistence of multiple phytoplankton as well? Because except phytoplanktons competing for the 2 resources, the existence of zooplankton also enables the apparent competition between the phytoplanktons. According to literature, if there is a trade-off between two phytoplankton (resource and grazing), then one  resource and one zooplankton could enhance the coexistence of these two phyto. Therefore, I predicted 2 resources and 2 zoo, should be able to maintain the coexistence of more phyto. Coexistence of phyto can in turn support 2 zoo as well.
