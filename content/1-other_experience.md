Conducted prospective study to investigate associations between regular and decaffeinated coffee intakes and tumor angiogenesis measured by microvessel density, vessel size, and irregularity in >560 diagnosed prostate cancer patients:
Processed data from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Adjusted for other coffee category and potential confounders by linear regression. Performed sensitivity analysis on cancer stage at time of diagnosis.
Observed no significant association, suggesting coffee consumption might affect prostate cancer risk through other mechanisms uninvolved with angiogenesis.  ?


?LG Rahme Lab, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA
Summer research assistant
Jun.-Aug.2018
Supervisor: Dr. Amy Tsurumi

?Built model to predict vulnerability to infections in burn and trauma patients in prospective cohort study:
Processed data collected for the Inflammation and Host Response to Injury (Glue Grant) study based on study design. Conducted massive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. 
Employed stepwise, Lasso, and Ridge regression to select predictors. Employed multivariate logistic regression to predict infection event. Assessed performance by cross-validation based on AUROC.

?Studied effect of meat exudate on biofilm formation of Listeria Monocytogenes (LM):
Sampled >200 raw meat products from markets and proliferated, isolated, identified LM. Incubated LM biofilm using meat exudate produced through freeze-thaw cycles from raw chicken, pork, and beef.
Inspected LM biofilm with polystyrene microtiter plate assay. Compared formation abilities among different LM serotypes and meat exudate origins.

Promoted extraction efficiency of anthocyanin from purple sweet potatoes (PSPs). Studied antioxidant activity of anthocyanin-rich extracts from PSPs in C. elegans:
Applied aqueous two-phase system for PSPs extraction and optimized extraction conditions (pH, ethanol and ammonium sulfate concentration) using a Box-Behnken model design with four responses (desirability of 0.908).
Acquired C. elegans and maintained them independently for 3 months. Cultured strain N2 with PSPs extracts and induced oxidative stress in worms with juglone. Observed prolonged average LT50 by 21.4% with P value <0.001.
