Master thesis project<br/>
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA<br/>
*Nov.2018 - May.2019*<br/>
Advisor: Dr. Edward Giovannucci, Dr. Kathryn Wilson

- Conducted prospective study to investigate associations between regular and decaffeinated coffee intakes and tumor angiogenesis measured by microvessel density, vessel size, and irregularity in >560 diagnosed prostate cancer patients:
	- Processed data from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Adjusted for other coffee category and potential confounders by linear regression. Performed sensitivity analysis on cancer stage at time of diagnosis.
	- Observed no significant association, suggesting coffee consumption might affect prostate cancer risk through other mechanisms uninvolved with angiogenesis.  


LG Rahme Lab, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA<br/>
*Jun.-Aug.2018*<br/>
Supervisor: Dr. Laurence Rahme, Dr. Amy Tsurumi <br/>
                     
- Built model to predict vulnerability to infections in burn and trauma patients in prospective cohort study: 
	- Processed data collected for the Inflammation and Host Response to Injury (Glue Grant) study based on study design. Conducted massive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. 
	- Employed stepwise, Lasso, and Ridge regression to select predictors. Employed multivariate logistic regression to predict infection event. Assessed performance by cross-validation based on AUROC. 


Undergraduate thesis project<br/>
Food Safety and Microorganism, SJTU-Bor S.Luh Food Safety Research Center, Shanghai, China<br/>
*Mar.2016 - May.2017*<br/>
Advisor: Dr. Chunlei Shi

- Studied effect of meat exudate on biofilm formation of Listeria Monocytogenes (LM):
	- Sampled >200 raw meat products from markets and proliferated, isolated, identified LM. Incubated LM biofilm using meat exudate produced through freeze-thaw cycles from raw chicken, pork, and beef.
	- Inspected LM biofilm with polystyrene microtiter plate assay. Compared formation abilities among different LM serotypes and meat exudate origins.


*Mar.-Aug.2015*<br/>
Advisor: Dr. Pu Jing

- Promoted extraction efficiency of anthocyanin from purple sweet potatoes (PSPs). Studied antioxidant activity of anthocyanin-rich extracts from PSPs in C. elegans:
	- Applied aqueous two-phase system for PSPs extraction and optimized extraction conditions (pH, ethanol and ammonium sulfate concentration) using a Box-Behnken model design with four responses (desirability of 0.908).
	- Acquired C. elegans and maintained them independently for 3 months. Cultured strain N2 with PSPs extracts and induced oxidative stress in worms with juglone. Observed prolonged average LT50 by 21.4\% with P value <0.001.
