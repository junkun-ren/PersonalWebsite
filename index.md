### Junkun Ren  
<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size:1em;">_Peking University_ </span> 


I am currently working with [Dr. Shaopeng Wang](http://scholar.pku.edu.cn/spwang) at the Theoretical Ecology Group at Peking University (Beijing, China) on a project theoretically investigating stoichiometry in food web and consequent coexistence and BEF relationship, and working with [Dr. Dorothy Wallace](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~dwallace/) on a project previously initiated at Dartmouth College studying the migration of tiger salamander enabled by phenotypic plasticity. 

Prior to joining the theoretical ecology lab at Peking University, I worked as a research assistant at the Space Medicine Lab at Dartmouth College to [Dr. Jay Buckey](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/faculty/facultydb/view.php/?uid=426), doing data analysis and epidemiological analysis. I studied epidemiology at Harvard University and food science & engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

### Research interests

I am particularly passionate about understanding and developing models and theories related to ecology and biology. My research interests include community ecology, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, food-webs, stability, etc. I am also interested in applying mathematical modeling to questions about infectious disease transmission.
