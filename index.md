I am currently working with [Dr. Shaopeng Wang](http://scholar.pku.edu.cn/spwang) at the Theoretical Ecology Group at Peking University in Beijing, China and working on a project previously initiated at Dartmouth College with [Dr. Dorothy Wallace](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~dwallace/). 

Prior to working at the theoretical ecology lab at Peking University, I worked as a research assistant at the Space Medicine Lab at Dartmouth College to [Dr. Jay Buckey](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/faculty/facultydb/view.php/?uid=426), doing data analysis and epidemiological analysis. I studied epidemiology at Harvard University and food science & engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

## Research interests

I am particularly passionate about understanding and developing models and theories related to ecology and biology. My research interests include community ecology, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, food-webs, stability, etc. I am also interested in applying mathematical modeling to questions about infectious disease transmission.
